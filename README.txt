Goal:       Develop a program that imports a .txt (or Excel) file and reads its
            contents, making cookie-cutter captions for photos.

Client:     The Lovely Mallory Smith

Developer:  Zac Monroe

Start Date: 15 Dec 2017

I (Zac) would like to implement several types of captions (multiple templates)
that the user (Mallory) could choose from.
